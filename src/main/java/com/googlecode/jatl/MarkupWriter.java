/**
 * 
 * Wrap builders for deferred writing.
 * <p>
 * This is useful when you want to define the markup but do not
 * have the {@link Writer} yet. 
 * <p> Often this is the case when:
 * <ul>
 * <p>
 * <li>MVC framework (such as Spring MVC) where the writer is not available
 * till rendering time. </li>
 * <li>Composition of builders.</li>
 * </ul>
 * You can achieve <strong>functional composition</strong> of markup builders by creating methods that return {@link MarkupWriter}s.
 * <pre>
	private static HtmlWriter createInput(final String name, final String value) {
		return new HtmlWriter() {
			protected void build() {
				input().name(name).value(value).end();
			}
		};
	}
	
	private static HtmlWriter createForm(final HtmlWriter ... inputs) {
		return new HtmlWriter() {
			protected void build() {
				form().write(inputs).end();
			}
		};
	}
 * </pre>
 * <em>Notice that the above methods are static as they are used as functions and do not mutate their containing class.</em>
 * <p>
 * See {@link MarkupBuilder#write(MarkupWriter...)}
 * <p>
 * @author agent
 * @see HtmlWriter
 * @see MarkupBuilder#write(MarkupWriter...)
